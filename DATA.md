# Data

This project uses the dataset linked inside the tutorial reference below:

- Tutorial (includes dataset download link):

## How to use the data

1. Download the dataset from the tutorial link.
2. Place the CSV in:

```
data/raw/
```

The notebook expects a file named:

```
Competition_Data.csv
```

So you can either:
- name your file `Competition_Data.csv`, or
- update the `CSV_PATH` variable in the notebook.

> `data/raw/` is git-ignored by default to avoid committing external datasets.
